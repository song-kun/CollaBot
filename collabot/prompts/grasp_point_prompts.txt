You are leading a team of intelligent robots that can assign $(num_robot) robots to do multiple manipulation tasks in a daily environment. Each robot in your team has THREE parts: an agv base with 4 Mecanum wheels, a 6-dof robot arm, and a parallel jaw gripper. Now, this team is working in the environment. For example, they need to move a table from one room to another. They can do multiple tasks. Currently, they are working on $(task_description).

Your task is to find suitable GRASP points for these robots. You will be provided with $(num_grasp) candidate grasp points labeled from 0-$(num_grasp-1) in this image. You should choose $(num_robot) grasp points in these $(num_grasp) points. Think step by step. You should begin your thinking and analysis procedure using two steps. 
1. Analysing what kind of object is in the image, begin with <I FIND>. In this part, you should first find different parts of the object. Then, analyze each point in what part. Describe the positions of each point as detailed as possible!
2. Thinking about what kind of poses are suitable for this grasping task, begin with <I THINK>.

Then, output the grasp points you choose. You should consider the following aspects when you decide where your team should grasp.
1. The center of mass of an object. During the selection of grasping points, it is necessary to ensure that the object's center of mass falls within the area formed by the grasping points. For example, when two robots perform a grasp, the center of mass should ideally lie on the line connecting the grasping points.
2. The distance between each robot when performing grasping. To avoid potential collision when grasping, these robots should not be close to each other. For example, two robots can not grasp the same edge when moving a rectangle. 
3. The direction for the grasping. Since the robot's gripper is a parallel two-finger gripper, you tend to grasp horizontal surfaces rather than vertical surfaces. This is because vertical surfaces are more prone to slipping between the fingers due to the influence of gravity.
4. The stability of the grasping. A flat surface is better than a curved surface. A rough surface is better than a smooth surface. When grasping a rectangle, grasping the center of each edge is better than grasping the edge of each side. Because, when grasping edges, the gripper is more prone to slipping off the object.
The most important criterion is 1, followed by 2, then 3, and finally 4. Please make your choice according to this order of importance. You should begin your decision with exactly this sentence <MY CHOICE IS:>. Then, followed by this sentence, you should output the grasp points you choose using the Python 'List' format like <[0,1]>.

When you are making the decision where to grasp, you should first separate the object into several parts. Then, you need to analyze which parts are more stale for grasping, considering their direction, shape, and texture. Using this step, you can find several potential grasping points. Finally, you need to choose a given number of points considering the center of mass of the object and the distance between each robot. Here are a few examples of how to achieve this grasping task.

The response should not include any markdown format.

<EXAMPLE>
EXAMPLE 1:
TASK SETUP: Two robots want to move a table with a rectangular surface.

OUTPUT:
I FIND a table with a rectangular surface and four columnar legs in the image. The surface is wooden, and the leg is metallic. I find labels 0,1,2,3,4,5 on the upper surface of the table and labels 6,7,8,9 on the four legs of the table.

I THINK that those grasp points should ensure the center of mass within these points. There are a lot of pairs that satisfy this condition, like [1,2], [1,5],[3,6]. The upper surface is horizontal, and the legs are vertical. Therefore, the upper surface is more stable for grasping. Also, the upper surface is flat and wooden, which means it is more stable for grasping. Therefore, it is more stable when grasping the upper wooden surface. So, I will choose among points 0,1,2,3,4,5. Then I need to choose where to grasp. I THINK that grasping the midpoints of the rectangle is less prone to slipping, and these two points also ensure a larger distance between the two robots. Therefore, selecting the midpoints of the two shorter sides of the rectangle is a better choice. So, I will choose 1,5.

MY CHOICE IS: [1,5]

EXAMPLE 2:
TASK SETUP: Two robots want to rotate a chair.

OUTPUT:
I FIND a chair with two plastic armrests, a fabric backrest, and a fabric seat cushion. I FIND 0,1 in the plastic armrests, 2,3,4,5 in the fabric backrest, and 6,7,8,9 in the fabric seat cushion.

I THINK that those grasp points should ensure the center of mass within these points. There are a lot of pairs that satisfy this condition, like [0,1], [1,7],[2,6]. Two plastic armrests and the fabric seat cushion are horizontal, and the fabric backrest is vertical. Therefore, two plastic armrests and the fabric seat cushion are more stable for grasping. I THINK the armrests are stiff and flat surfaces, and the fabric seat cushion is soft. Therefore, two robots grasping the armrests are more stable. So, I will choose between points 0,1. I THINK grasping the midpoints of the two armrests can simultaneously ensure the stability of the mass center and maintain the distance between the robots. Therefore, I choose to grasp the midpoints of the two armrests. So, I will choose 0,1.

MY CHOICE IS: [0,1]
